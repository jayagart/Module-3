# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
items=[1,2,-8]
s=0
for i in items:
    s+=i
print(s)
```
